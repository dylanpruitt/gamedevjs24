# Gamedev.js 2024 Submission

The theme of [Gamedev.js 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2024) is "power".

In the game, you have a daily quota to meet through mining, but all of your tools (drill/flashlight/sword) share power. Players need to ration their power when mining, or else risk losing power during the night, where navigation is difficult and monsters roam about.

## Tech Used

This game was created with the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine.

I composed the music for the game using [MuseScore](https://musescore.com/), which isn't really a DAW - it's a sheet music notation program - but it allows exporting music to .wav/.mp3/.ogg/etc. files.

Sound effects for the game were taken from [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/) and modified using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).

Sprites for the game were created using [Piskelapp](https://www.piskelapp.com/), a free online pixel art editor.


## Game Design

(this section is still a work in progress)

When I started drafting ideas for the game, my biggest priority was encouraging the player to take risky plays.

Speed/Warps

Valuable ores like coal/iron emit a soft glow; I used these throughout the map to lead the player.
## Comments

I've always wanted to participate in a game jam, but never could find the motivation, so I took this opportunity to join and follow through with a finished game. Although I've done a lot of professional work with HTML/JS/CSS (with examples in some of my other repositories), I used Godot to develop this game to gain experience with a new game engine that could export to builds beyond the web.

I was very impressed with the amount of features Godot has - it took me about 10-15 hours to really get comfortable working with the editor, but after getting a basic understanding of Godot I was able to quickly implement a wide variety of features in the game.
## Credits

All sprites/music were created by me. See [credits.md](credits.md) for SFX credits.
